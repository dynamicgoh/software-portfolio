                <p>Developing software systems has not always been a number 1 choice for me after completing my high school. As I have 
                always been interested in mathematics, I was constantly recommended to studying engineering. However, many suggested
                electronics engineering for me as the course requires complex mathematical computations that has further peaked my 
                interest. Besides, the electronics field has also exposed me into developing smart devices that can help further shaped
                the future of technology. However, my direction has shifted ever since there was a subject that I had to study which 
                is developing software systems. After completing this course, I managed to develop my very first software system which
                is an electronic library management. This is when I discovered my interest for programming. Programming has always stimulate
                 my mind as it has given me the opportunity to come up with algorithms and logical solutions to solving problems related to
                computer programs and coding. I have also done some side software projects and self-studying on programming during my spare time to further enhance my skills as a programmer.
                It is also crucial for electronics engineers to have good programming skills as to program hardware. Therefore, I am 
                planning to branch out into the IT field and furher improve myself as a Programmer.</p>

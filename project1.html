                <p>
                    One of the earliest full-fledge software systems that have been developed by me is this library management
                    system which is also one of my academic projects done during my diploma. Developing this system has introduced
                    me with various important concepts such as the flow of the program and the creation of DFD Diagrams which is
                    significant for project development.The library system developed
                    is for two different types of users which are the librarian and the customers. The library system is
                    developed through the use of Visual Basic to create the application forms which serves as an interface
                    for the users. The library system is able to perform basic functions which is to borrow and return books
                    as well as for setting the library rules and policies for the librarian. The management system also
                    consisted of database which done through Microsoft Access to store all the book and user information to
                    simulate a real library experience. Some of the features are demonstrated as shown in the following.
                </p>

                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" class="center" style="width:500px;" /></a>
                <p>
                    One of the features implemented would be the login page which allows the user to identify as librarian
                    or a customer. For testing purposes, an example username and password was shown at the interface for
                    easy access. The librarian will have an extra feature which is to set the rules for the library.
                </p>
                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" class="center" style="width:500px;" /></a>
                <p>
                    The main feature for this library management system would be the book loan and returning system which
                    allows users to borrow library books. The interface will display a list of books available in the library
                    and show their status to the users. It also have a search bar which makes book finding easier from a
                    large database of books.
                </p>
                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" class="center" style="width:500px;" /></a>
                <p>
                    Another important feature which is exclusive for the librarian users is that it has a system which 
                    can adjust the rules and policies of the library such as allowing the number of books to be borrowed
                    per users or the fines for late return of the books. This is to further enhance and add flexibility 
                    to the system.
